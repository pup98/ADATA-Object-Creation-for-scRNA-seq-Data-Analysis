# ADATA-Object-Creation-for-scRNA-seq-Data-Analysis

This ipynb file has different way to make adata object for analysing scRNA-seq data analysis. 
I have preferably used ScanPy for my workflow ... # Python_freak ....... cannot help it! 

As we know that the data in feild of scRNA-seq comes in various formats, and it becomes cumbersome to handle all the file formats to create a adata aobject. 
Here you can find examples as to how we handle different file formats at source and easily create a adata object for the required analysis. The scripts cannot be copied 
directly, altough you can infer them to design your own as they might provide you a backbone to work around.

Cheers!
